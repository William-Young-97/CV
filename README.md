## My approach

I am passionate about building quality practices into my life. This is also my philosophy when it comes to coding. As a Makers graduate, I follow test driven development approaches, and object oriented programming principles. Team cohesion can often make or break a project. With this in mind I strive to from relationships that are underpined by trust and honesty, so that I can be conscientious with myself and others. Finally, I believe in work-balance and the ability to recognise your own mental wellbeing. This is important as proper mental hygiene allows for a more productive and fuffilling life.

## Skills
- **Interpersonal**: I am a natural empath, which helps me to more acurately gauge the needs and feelings of others, leading to a productive work environment.
- **Growth mindeset**: I hold the belief that you can learn anything as long as you work at it. This translates into a persistent yearning to be the best person I can be.
- **Proccess oriented**: I understand the importance of goals, whilst appreciating that the focus should be on what you're doing to each day to reach them, not on the results.
