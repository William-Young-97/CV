# Personal profile

I am passionate about building quality practices into my life. This is also my philosophy when it comes to coding. As a Makers graduate, I follow test driven development approaches, and object oriented programming principles. I also have experience working with others in team based environments. Most importantly, my time at Makers has made me comfortable with learning new technologies.
