# **William Young**

I am an eager student who is currently enrolled in the Makers coding bootcamp. I’ve built simple programs and performed quality learning for long durations. I’m looking to work with others on projects that bring value to people's lives. Currently, this means developing my skills and brainstorming ideas.

## Skills

### Pressure management

Previously, I worked in direct sales and had pressure to hit targets. To do this I had to think methodically about my process, and apply the correct amount of volume to see results. I have achieved seven door to door sales in a day, overcoming challenges such as constant rejection, poor weather conditions and daily time constraints. I have also competed at Judo on a national and international level. I have placed on the podium in many competitions, most notably winning a gold medal in the London open. I was able to do this by focusing on the task at hand, and using the pressure of winning, to keep myself moving into beneficial positions. 

### Active listener

Active listening is about listening closely to others and picking up on specifics. This means that you can adhere to their needs easier. This is important for sales as you can tailor benefits to the customer. This means I am good at following instructions precisely, which is important for programming. For example, I’ve had customers ask why they should use our service over another. I asked them about weaker areas of business and we concluded that we could help them with marketing on instagram. As a result I was able to gain a sale and a satisfied customer

### Ruby

I am currently learning Ruby and have built some simple applications with it. For example I have built a simple blackjack game. The main challenge, and learning objective, was applying the rules of abstraction. I initially built a working game, however, it failed the RSpec tests as the methods were not simple enough. I had tried to add too many functions to one method. I then spent an hour refactoring the code. The end result was a working game, with clear and concise code.
