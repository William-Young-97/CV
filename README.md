# **William Young**

I am an eager graduate from Makers coding bootcamp. Iâ€™ve built simple programs, in Ruby such as my bank tech test, through test driven development. I've also developed websites in team, such as my final project, which is an app to track your movies and books. This gave me experience working in agile teams, with sprints and deadlines.

## Skills

### Can quickly learn technologies

Makers has taught me how to be a self sufficient software engineer. This means that I feel confident in my ability yo quickly learn a new technology or language as required. For example, my final project involved learning Node.js, Javascript, Express, Sequelize, Postgres, CSS, Jest and Pupeeter. Though I'm not a specialist with any of these technologies, I am competent enough to know how they work, and use them to create a dynamic website. 

### Pressure management

Previously, I worked in direct sales and had pressure to hit targets. To do this I had to think methodically about my process, and apply the correct amount of volume to see results. I have achieved seven door to door sales in a day, overcoming challenges such as constant rejection, poor weather conditions and daily time constraints. I have also competed at Judo on a national and international level.  

### Active listener

Active listening is about listening closely to others and picking up on specifics. This means that you can adhere to their needs easier. I find this very helpful in interpersonal situations, as it lessens conflict and improves teamwork. It's also useful for adhering to specific work objectives, such as designing a page in a certain way. 

### Ruby

I am very comfortable with Ruby, having built some a variety of projects with it. For example, I've built simple dice and blackjack games, whilst following the rules of OOP and TDD. I plan to do some more projects in Ruby, though I will soon be focusing my efforts more towards Javascript.
